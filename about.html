<!-- WHY WE STARTED -->
<section class="about-mission">
  <h2>Why We Started Faith & Fire Survival</h2>

  <p>
    Faith & Fire Survival was born out of a conviction that true preparedness goes deeper than physical skill.
    In a world growing more uncertain, we saw a need for training that strengthens both the body and the spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Too often, survival education focuses solely on gear and technique, while faith is treated as separate or secondary.
    We believe Scripture teaches otherwise. From the wilderness journeys of Israel to Christ’s time alone in the desert,
    God has always used the outdoors to refine, teach, and strengthen His people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is to equip men, women, and families with practical survival skills while deepening their walk with God —
    building courage, resilience, and leadership that carries into everyday life.
